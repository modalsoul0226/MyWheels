Adjacent
  A vertex is adjacent to another vertex if they share an edge.

Bipartite
  A bipartite graph is a graph in which the vertices are divided into two disjoint sets such that each vertex in the first set is adjacent to each vertex in the second set.

Bridge
  A bridge is an edge that is not a part of a cycle, i.e. would sever the graph if removed.

Component
  A component is a set of vertices that are all connected.

Cycle
  A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

Degree
  The degree of a vertex is the number of adjacent vertices.

Graph
  A graph is defined as :math:`G = {V, E}` where ``V`` is the set of vertices and ``E`` is the set of edges.

Simple Path
  A simple path is a path with no repeated vertices.

Sink Vertex
  The sink vertex is the vertex with out-degree 0.

Source Vertex
  The source vertex is the vertex with in-degree 0.

Spanning Tree
  A subgraph that is a tree which includes all vertices of the original graph.
